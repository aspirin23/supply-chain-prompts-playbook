# AI Prompts for the Enterprise

A practitioner's guide to prompting LLMs for industry and enterprise — covering key use cases from **CPG & Retail**, **Manufacturing**, and **Energy & Utilities** industries.

This repo is built around a core prompting framework first. The industry prompt libraries are worked examples of that framework applied to real operational problems.

---

## Who this is for

- Industry professionals exploring practical LLM use cases
- Enterprise teams evaluating AI adoption in CPG, retail, manufacturing, or energy
- Industry planners and analysts looking to augment their workflow with AI
- Prompt engineers building domain-specific AI tools

## How to use this repo

1. **Read the prompting guide first** — [`prompting-guide.md`](./prompting-guide.md) gives you the framework. Even if you only want the prompts, skimming the guide will make you significantly better at adapting them.
2. **Go deeper on a pattern** — if one of the five patterns feels relevant to a problem you're working on, the [`prompt patterns/`](./prompt-patterns/) folder has a full breakdown with industry-specific examples and failure modes.
3. **Browse the industry folders** — each prompt is a worked example of the framework applied to a specific operational problem.
4. **Copy, adapt, use** — prompts include placeholders in `[brackets]`. Swap in your own context and run them in your preferred LLM.

## Industries covered

| Industry | Focus areas |
|----------|-------------|
| 🛒 CPG & Retail | Demand forecasting, promotion planning, inventory optimisation, consumer behaviour, last-mile logistics |
| 🏭 Manufacturing | Production planning, capacity optimisation, supplier risk, predictive maintenance, quality control |
| ⚡ Energy & Utilities | Load forecasting, asset performance, grid optimisation, ESG reporting, energy procurement |
| 📦 General Supply Chain | S&OP, risk summarisation, KPI analysis, stakeholder reporting, scenario planning |

## Prompt format

Every prompt in the industry libraries follows this structure:

```
### Prompt name
**Use case:** What business problem this solves
**When to use:** The scenario or trigger for using this prompt
**Prompt:** The actual prompt text — ready to copy and adapt
**Why this works:** How this prompt applies the framework principles
```

The **Why this works** section is what separates this from a plain prompt dump — it explains the prompting logic so you can adapt and extend each example yourself.
